Hannah by Freelance Whales
2009

Do me this solid
If you would pretty lady
Please grab me a martini
And meet me on the balcony
I've prepared a light show
You could fake a melody
We could argue over where and when
The cymbal hits should be

Hannah takes the stairs
And I usually take the elevator
Every now and then she offers me
A lemon Now and Later
Please don't play the match maker
Please don't be a player hater
If you dig her recent work
You should go congratulate her

And if you're partial to the night sky
If you're vaguely attracted to rooftops
Hannah takes the stairs
Cause she can't tell that
Its a winding spiral case
Is she right side up
Or upside-down?

So Hannah let your roots grow
Let your blue legs show
If I need to take a breath
Then you can take a trumpet solo
I'll work on the limbs if
You work on the torso
If it gets to be too much then
You can lend a helping hand

And if you're partial to the night sky
If you're vaguely attracted to rooftops
Hannah takes the stairs
Cause she can't tell that
Its a winding spiral case
Is she right side up
Or upside-down?

Hannah takes the stairs
Cause she can't tell that
Its a winding spiral case
Is she outside-in
Or inside out?
