        <h2>Let's get started...</h2>
        <h3>A small ancedote-</h3>
        <p> Studying UX design has kept me from coding for a long time... until now! I actually enjoy it a lot and it is very neat learning the developer side of the process.</p>
        <p>I've done other project's that are in other subjects and fields. Here is <a
                    href="https://www.notion.so/Hello-I-m-Tori-20f2da9b8eff80afa265c9f0e6f06409"> my personal portfolio</a> where I keep my favorites!</p>
        <p> I don't think I'll ever become a master-coder where I'm completely building apps and websites from the ground up, but to me it is super important to be able to speak both the language of graphical interfaces and developers.</p>
        <p><strong>Anyways...</strong> here is a little about myself as we get started.</p>
        <h2>Tori's Hobbies</h2>
        <p>The following list is what I like to do in my freetime when I'm not studying for school.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Listening to music</li>
            <li>Reading books (I am a fan of fantasy books and psychological non fiction books)</li>
            <li>Playing video games</li>
            <li>Hanging out with my cat, Jasper</li>
            <li>Excercising (indoors and outdoors)</li>
            <li>Spending time with friends and family</li>
        </ul>
