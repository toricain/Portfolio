        <p>I am a senior pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Psychology with an option in Human Factors and Design with a minor in Data Visualization from Penn State Erie, The Behrend College.</p>
        
        <p>My areas of expertise include research, app development, user testing, data visualization, digital marketing, graphic design, and consulting for small businesses and entrepreneurs.</p>

            <p><span style="color: #F8F7F4;"> Studying UX design has kept me from coding for a long time... until now! I actually enjoy it a lot and it is very neat learning the developer side of the process.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #F8F7F4;">I've done other project's that are in other subjects and fields. Here is <a

            <p><span style="color: #F8F7F4;">I don't think I'll ever become a master-coder where I'm completely building apps and websites from the ground up, but to me it is super important to be able to speak both the language of graphical interfaces and developers.</span></p>
