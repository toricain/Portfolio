        <h2>Reflection Essay</h2>
            <p style="text-indent: 3em;">The most significant challenges for a new learner of GitHub Pages are learning commands and not breaking your code as you’re going. The largest learning curve, by far, was the commands for Git, HTML, and CSS, all at the same time, and applying them to a website. With GitHub Pages, you have much more control over the way that your website looks and functions, both stylistically and content-wise. Modifying the layout and organization of your site is moderately challenging, as you have to toggle between your CSS and HTML code, sometimes taking time to fuss and get things right. The skills that are necessary to learn and develop a GitHub Pages site are attention to detail, analytical skills, pattern recognition, and organization skills. You really have to take your time and be extra meticulous to not break your code. Even just a little bit of carelessness or brute force can hurt your website. The skills I think I want to learn to improve on this website are CSS and memorization of HTML code shortcuts. I would also enjoy learning more advanced coding down the line. </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 3em;">The most significant challenges for a new learner of WordPress are learning the contents of each menu and the limitations of what you can/ cannot do in WordPress. Additionally, learning where to put code is a learning curve, especially if you do not know how to code. The advantages that are associated with WordPress include user friendliness and ease of use. Since it’s all a graphical interface, the user doesn’t have to worry about memorizing code, and it is an easy way to make a website. Another advantage is the website themes or templates that WordPress provides, which are made by graphic designers. This takes the CSS headache out of the equation of website building. Modifying the layout and organization of the WordPress website is less flexible than GitHub Pages. This is one of the largest challenges when using WordPress. You have preset containers that sit on the website where WordPress drops them. If you want any flexibility, you have to put some sort of code into WordPress. The skills that are necessary to learn and develop a WordPress site are patience and flexibility. This is because of the extra time it will take to orient oneself to all of the menus and rules of WordPress. I think I would want to learn WordPress shortcuts pretty generally, either through tutorials or self-exploration. There didn’t seem to be much learning associated with WordPress, as much as it was user orientation around the application.</p>

        <h2>Comparative Analysis of Text Corpora</h2>
            <p>For this comparative analysis, I am looking at an Obama Corpus and a Trump Corpus.</p>
            <p>There are many similar 3 word n-grams between both Obama and Trump</p>
            <figure id="trigram">
                <img src="images/ngram3obama.png"/>
                <img src="images/ngram3trump.png"/>
            </figure>
            <p>One of the 3 word n-grams is "men and women", which looks different with the surrounding context for both Obama and Trump.</p>
